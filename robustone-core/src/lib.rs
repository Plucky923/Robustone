//! Robustone â€“ Core disassembly engine with multi-architecture support.
//!
//! This crate provides a flexible, extensible disassembly framework inspired by
//! Capstone's design but implemented in pure Rust. The architecture is designed
//! to support multiple instruction set architectures through a unified interface.
//!
//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! The disassembly engine is built around several key abstractions:
//!
//! - **ArchitectureHandler**: Trait that all architecture-specific disassemblers must implement
//! - **ArchitectureDispatcher**: Runtime dispatcher that selects the appropriate handler
//! - **Utils**: Common utilities for hex parsing, endianness handling, etc.
//!
//! # Adding New Architectures
//!
//! To add support for a new architecture:
//!
//! 1. Create a new module in `src/` (e.g., `src/arm/`)
//! 2. Implement the `ArchitectureHandler` trait for your architecture
//! 3. Register the handler in `ArchitectureDispatcher::new()`
//! 4. Add appropriate feature flags in `Cargo.toml`
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use robustone_core::prelude::*;
//! use robustone_core::ArchitectureDispatcher;
//!
//! let dispatcher = ArchitectureDispatcher::new();
//! match dispatcher.disassemble_bytes(&[0x90, 0x90], "x86", 0x1000) {
//!     Ok((instruction, size)) => {
//!         println!("Instruction: {} {}", instruction.mnemonic, instruction.operands);
//!     }
//!     Err(DisasmError::UnsupportedArchitecture(arch)) => {
//!         eprintln!("Architecture '{}' not supported", arch);
//!     }
//!     Err(e) => {
//!         eprintln!("Disassembly error: {:?}", e);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// Trait that all architecture-specific disassemblers must implement.
///
/// This trait provides a unified interface for disassembling instructions
/// across different architectures. Each architecture handler is responsible
/// for parsing the raw byte representation of instructions and converting
/// them into a standardized `Instruction` format.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All implementations must be thread-safe (`Sync`) because handlers may
/// be shared across multiple threads in the dispatcher.
///
/// # Required Methods
///
/// * `disassemble`: Core method that performs the actual disassembly
/// * `name`: Returns the canonical name of the architecture
/// * `supports`: Checks if the handler supports a given architecture name
///
/// # Example Implementation
///
/// ```rust
/// use robustone_core::prelude::*;
///
/// pub struct MyArchitectureHandler;
///
/// impl ArchitectureHandler for MyArchitectureHandler {
///     fn disassemble(&self, bytes: &[u8], addr: u64) -> Result<(Instruction, usize), DisasmError> {
///         // Architecture-specific disassembly logic here
///         todo!("Implement actual disassembly logic")
///     }
///
///     fn name(&self) -> &'static str {
///         "myarch"
///     }
///
///     fn supports(&self, arch_name: &str) -> bool {
///         arch_name == "myarch" || arch_name == "myarch32" || arch_name == "myarch64"
///     }
